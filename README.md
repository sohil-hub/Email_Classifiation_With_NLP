# Email_Classifiation_With_NLP

This is a Natural alnguage processing based project, in which I tried to train a model that can predict whether an email is a spam or not.

#Dataset
The dataset is having around 5500 examples.
This dataset is imbalanced dataset since it has around 46-47k examples belong to one class and remaining belongs to another class. I used downsampling to avoid this problem.
